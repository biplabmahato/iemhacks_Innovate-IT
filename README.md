Problem Statement:
The escalating impacts of climate change are giving rise to a surge in extreme weather events, notably droughts and floods. These events have far-reaching consequences, including the devastation of crops and a substantial impediment to farmers' ability to maintain consistent food production. Often farmers harvest their crops before time which leads to wastage of food due to massive availability. Addressing this issue necessitates an innovative solution that empowers farmers to effectively adapt to the changing climate conditions and present their crop to a market place when most markets reject to buy the crops.
